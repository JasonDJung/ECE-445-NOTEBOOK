# Isha's ECE 445 Lab Notebook

## 8/31: Meeting with Professor Gruev
We met with Professor Gruev to discuss the intricacies of his pitched project and clear up any of our doubts regarding the vision for the solution. Afterward, we created and submitted our RFA to the web board. 

## 9/4: Component Research & Project Timeline
We created a rough timeline for the remainder of the semester to have a general indication of when we would like to complete certain tasks. Afterward, we spent a couple of hours researching an image sensor that fit all the necessary criteria.

## 9/7: Component Research & Team Contract
We received confirmation from Prof. Gruev that the image sensor we chose was perfect for the scope of our project. Began researching microcontrollers that were MIPI and USB 3.0 compatible while staying within the desired size range. 
Additionally, we started and finished the team contract due 9/14.

## 9/11: Component Finalization & Project Proposal
We received feedback from Prof. Gruev related to the MCUs we found and used the feedback to narrow down and pick an MCU for the project. Worked on the deliverables necessary for our first TA meeting on 9/12 which included a [block diagram](https://keep.google.com/u/1/#NOTE/1Vw31qFGlAr-CA18edX1kXamcl7HZGzVYBTEl_JOEE6JA1ADldyCIwDYG-8dt6xKz), three high-level requirements, and one subsystem requirement.  
Finally, we began working on our project proposal which is due on 9/14.

## 9/12: First TA Meeting
We had our first meeting with our TA, Jason, and discussed our project as well as our concerns. Afterward, we researched microcontrollers and development boards to find a dev board that was USB 3.0 and MIPI 2.0 compatible. 

## 9/14: Project Proposal Wrap Up
In this meeting, we finished the project proposal and found our desired image sensor/microcontroller. We sent out the email requests for the datasheets and quotes.

## 9/17: Start Design Document
We began working on the design document. 

## 9/21: Second TA Meeting/First meeting with TA and Professor Gruev
Finalized image sensor with Prof. Gruev and discussed design document, 3D modeling, and PCB design with TA. We continued working on the design document and began working on PCB design.

## 9/24: PCB Design
Sourced all required components, but cannot order due to lack of CFOP number. Worked on PCB design after adding all components to KiCAD.

## 9/25:

## 9/28: Wrapping up Design Document
In this meeting, we finished and submitted all necessary aspects for our design document.

## 9/29: Splitting PCB components
After finalizing the design document, we split up the components for the PCB design in order to speed up the process. Our device has three main components, the MCU, image sensor, and power/USB -- we split up each of the components among the three members of our group to finish by our next meeting. 

## 10/1: Cross checking PCB
Prior to this meeting, each member finished creating the schematic for their respective component, read all three datasheets, and looked at all other schematics. At this meeting, we cross-checked the schematics and any questions that arose during individual checking.

## 10/2: Design Review & Consolidating PCB
We had our official design review with Jason Zhang, David Null, and Professor Fliflet. Afterward, we combined our individual PCB schematics into one schematic and connected our components. 

## 10/3: PCB Questions at Office Hours
Once our PCB was finalized amongst the members of our group, we attended office hours to ask questions that remained after consolidating. 

## 10/6: PCB Review
Attended the PCB review to ask more clarifying questions. Began routing our schematic and determined that 2/3 of us would continue routing before our next meeting.
