## 8/31: Meeting with Professor Gruev
We met with Professor Gruev to discuss the intricacies of his pitched project and clear up any of our doubts regarding the vision for the solution. Afterwards, we created and submitted our RFA to the web board. 

## 9/4: Component Research & Project Timeline
We created a rough timeline for the remainder of the semester to have a general indication of when we would like to complete certain tasks by. Afterwards, we spent a couple hours researching an image sensor that fit all the necessary criteria.

## 9/7: Component Research & Team Contract
Received confirmation from Prof. Gruev that the image sensor we chose was perfect for the scope of our project. Began researching microcontrollers that were MIPI and USB 3.0 compatible while staying within the desired size range. 
Additionally, we started and finished the team contract due 9/14.

## 9/11: Component Finalization & Project Proposal
Received feedback from Prof. Gruev related to the MCU's we found and used the feedback to narrow down and pick a MCU for the project. Worked on the deliverables necessary for our first TA meeting on 9/12 which included a [block diagram](https://keep.google.com/u/1/#NOTE/1Vw31qFGlAr-CA18edX1kXamcl7HZGzVYBTEl_JOEE6JA1ADldyCIwDYG-8dt6xKz), three high-level requirement, and one subsystem requirement.  
Finally, we began working on our project proposal which is due on 9/14.
