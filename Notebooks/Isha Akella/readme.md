## 8/31: Meeting with Professor Gruev
We met with Professor Gruev to discuss the intricacies of his pitched project and clear up any of our doubts regarding the vision for the solution. Afterward, we created and submitted our RFA to the web board. 

## 9/4: Component Research & Project Timeline
We created a rough timeline for the remainder of the semester to have a general indication of when we would like to complete certain tasks. Afterward, we spent a couple of hours researching an image sensor that fit all the necessary criteria.

## 9/7: Component Research & Team Contract
We received confirmation from Prof. Gruev that the image sensor we chose was perfect for the scope of our project. Began researching microcontrollers that were MIPI and USB 3.0 compatible while staying within the desired size range. 
Additionally, we started and finished the team contract due 9/14.

## 9/11: Component Finalization & Project Proposal
We received feedback from Prof. Gruev related to the MCUs we found and used the feedback to narrow down and pick an MCU for the project. Worked on the deliverables necessary for our first TA meeting on 9/12 which included a [block diagram](https://keep.google.com/u/1/#NOTE/1Vw31qFGlAr-CA18edX1kXamcl7HZGzVYBTEl_JOEE6JA1ADldyCIwDYG-8dt6xKz), three high-level requirements, and one subsystem requirement.  
Finally, we began working on our project proposal which is due on 9/14.

## 9/12: First TA Meeting
We had our first meeting with our TA, Jason, and discussed our project as well as our concerns. Afterward, we researched microcontrollers and development boards to find a dev board that was USB 3.0 and MIPI 2.0 compatible. 

## 9/14: Project Proposal Wrap Up
In this meeting, we finished the project proposal and found our desired image sensor/microcontroller. We sent out the email requests for the datasheets and quotes.

## 9/17: Start Design Document
We began working on the design document. 

## 9/21: Second TA Meeting/First meeting with TA and Professor Gruev
Finalized image sensor with Prof. Gruev and discussed design document, 3D modeling, and PCB design with TA. Continued working on design document and began working on PCB design.

## 9/24: PCB Design
Sourced all required components, but cannot order due to lack of CFOP number. Worked on PCB design after adding all components to KiCAD.

## 9/25:

## 9/28: Wrapping up Design Document

## 9/29: Splitting PCB components

## 10/1: Cross checking PCB

## 10/2: Design Review & Consolidating PCB

## 10/3: PCB Questions with Jason P in OH
